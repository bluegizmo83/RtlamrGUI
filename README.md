# RtlamrGUI
Windows GUI interface for the popular Rtlamr command line application used for reading utility meters with an RTL-SDR.

*This program requires Rtlamr, written by Douglas Hall, and can be found here: https://github.com/bemasher/rtlamr*

This GUI interface was created in Python 2.7 with PyQt4. To use this GUI interface, you have two options:
- If you have Python 2.7 and PyQt4 installed on your system, just copy the files RtlamrGUI.pyw and RtlamrGUI.ui into the same folder where you installed Rtlamr to and then run RtlamrGUI.pyw

  OR

- Download the the compiled exe file RtlamrGUI.exe (in the Releases section of this github) and place it in the same folder you installed Rtlamr to and then run RtlamrGUI.exe. The compiled exe does not require you to have python installed on your system, as it contains all of the necessary python dependencies packaged within it (hence the larger file size).
